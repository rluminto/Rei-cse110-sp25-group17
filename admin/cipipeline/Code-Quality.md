## ‚úÖ Code Quality (Automated + Human Review)

High-quality code is the foundation of sustainable software. In our CI/CD pipeline, **code quality** refers to how well the code adheres to standards of **readability, maintainability, performance, testability**, and **scalability**. To ensure this, we enforce quality through both **automated tools** and **human review workflows**.

### üîç Code Quality via Tool: Static Analysis with CodeClimate

We use **CodeClimate**, a static code analysis platform, to automatically evaluate our codebase without executing it. It provides a range of metrics that help us keep our code clean and maintainable.

**Key metrics provided by CodeClimate:**
- **Cognitive complexity**: Measures how hard a function is to understand. Higher scores indicate the need for simplification.
- **Code duplication**: Detects repeated code blocks and encourages abstraction.
- **Maintainability score**: Offers a numeric indicator of codebase health.
- **Style violations**: Flags inconsistent formatting or bad practices.
- *(Planned)* **Test coverage tracking**: Will be added using Jest + CodeClimate or Coveralls.

**Integration into CI Pipeline:**
- CodeClimate is triggered on each pull request via GitHub integration.
- Results are posted directly to the pull request as a **status check** and **inline comments**.
- Developers are expected to resolve flagged issues or justify them during code review.

**Benefits:**
- Encourages small, well-structured functions.
- Helps identify design flaws early.
- Promotes consistent team-wide coding patterns.
- Reduces long-term **technical debt**.

### üëÄ Code Quality via Human Review: Pull Requests and Peer Feedback

While automated tools catch objective issues, human reviews provide contextual feedback. Every code change must go through a **Pull Request** (PR) process.

**Pull Request Requirements:**
- Must be reviewed by **at least two team members** before merging.
- Must pass all automated checks (linting, tests, static analysis).

**Reviewers check for:**
- **Logic clarity** ‚Äì Is the code understandable?
- **Correctness** ‚Äì Does the code achieve its intended purpose?
- **Edge cases** ‚Äì Are potential failure scenarios handled?
- **Documentation** ‚Äì Are functions and parameters properly explained?
- **Efficiency** ‚Äì Is the code performant and optimized?
- **Design quality** ‚Äì Does the code follow good modular and reusable structure?

**Advantages of Peer Review:**
- Catches issues tools may miss (e.g., confusing logic or poor naming).
- Spreads codebase knowledge across the team.
- Encourages collaborative problem-solving and feedback.
- Builds a shared sense of code ownership.

### üì¶ Summary

Our code quality checks combine the objectivity of **automated static analysis** (CodeClimate) with the insight of **human peer review**. Together, they ensure that every change to the codebase is thoughtful, consistent, and maintainable‚Äîsetting a strong foundation for future phases of development.
